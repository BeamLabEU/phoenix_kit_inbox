defmodule PhoenixKitInbox.Notify do
  @moduledoc """
  Side effects that fire after a message is delivered — activity logging,
  in-app notifications, and the optional outbound email nudge.

  Everything here is **best effort**. A notification that fails must never
  unsend a message that is already committed, so every function rescues, logs,
  and returns. Callers ignore the return value.

  ## The phoenix_kit_emails integration

  Inbox is an internal messaging system: messages live in this app's tables and
  are read in this app's UI. But a user who isn't looking at the app won't know
  a message arrived, so — **when the host also runs `phoenix_kit_emails`** — we
  send a short "you have a new message" nudge to the recipient's real email
  address.

  That integration is deliberately soft. `phoenix_kit_emails` is not in this
  module's `mix.exs`; `Code.ensure_loaded?/1` decides at runtime whether the
  nudge happens. Hosts running both modules get it for free, hosts running only
  Inbox are unaffected, and neither release cycle is coupled to the other.
